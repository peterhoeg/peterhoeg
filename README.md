I'm in the process of moving repos that I control away from GitHub.

What GitHub is doing with their CoPilot product is just wrong:

1. they are selling people's own code back to them
2. they completely disregard licenses
3. GH doesn't respect developers by completely disregarding their wishes to *not* have their own code be part of CoPilot
